## 2026-04-19 - Advance status and review-governance cleanup
- State: Done
- Scope: Rust alert live project-status normalization, TODO backlog cleanup, contract promotion guidance, mutation review-envelope inventory, focused tests, formatting, architecture checks, and AI trace docs. Public CLI behavior, generated docs, README files, and Python implementation are out of scope.
- Current Update: Routed the alert live status producer through the shared status reading model, removed stale completed work from the active backlog, documented runtime-vs-schema promotion rules, and captured an internal review-envelope inventory before any public JSON changes.
- Result: Focused alert/status tests, contract/schema checks, full Rust tests, clippy, formatting, architecture, and AI workflow checks pass locally.

## 2026-04-19 - Clarify contract ownership map
- State: Done
- Scope: `docs/internal/contract-doc-map.md`, contract registry routing notes, and trace docs. Runtime JSON output, schema manifests, public CLI behavior, generated docs, README files, and Python implementation are out of scope.
- Current Update: Clarified the boundary between runtime golden output contracts, CLI/docs routing contracts, docs-entrypoint navigation, and schema/help manifests so the maintainer map now names the source of truth for each layer explicitly.
- Result: The contract map now distinguishes `command-surface.json`, `docs-entrypoints.json`, `output-contracts.json`, and `schemas/manifests/` as separate ownership surfaces.
